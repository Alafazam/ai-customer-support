      "aiSummary": "Order packing process failure occurred due to a cascade of system errors starting with inventory verification. The root cause appears to be a database deadlock during high-concurrency operations.",
      "technicalRca": "Database deadlock occurred during simultaneous inventory updates, causing the packing process to fail. This was exacerbated by high system load during peak hours. The deadlock occurred in the inventory_locks table when multiple transactions attempted to acquire exclusive locks on overlapping inventory records. Transaction logs show concurrent attempts to update inventory levels from multiple packing stations.",
      "customerRca": "The order processing was temporarily delayed due to high system load during our peak hours. Our warehouse management system detected a resource conflict while processing multiple orders simultaneously. We have already implemented measures to prevent such conflicts and optimize our order processing capacity.",
